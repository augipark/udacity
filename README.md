# Udacity Project #1
Data Science Nanodegree

## Project Motivation
The purpose of this project is to do analysis on Seattle Airbnb data to see if I can generate any insights.

## Libraries and Installation
- import numpy as np
- import pandas as pd
- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- from matplotlib.pyplot import hist
- import seaborn as sns
- from IPython.display import display
- import random
- import math
- from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
- from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
- from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
- from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
- import plotly.express as px

## File Descriptions 
1. README.md - read me file
2. calendar.csv - Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day
3. listings.csv - Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
4. reviews.csv - Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
5. Seattle Airbnb Analysis-Copy1.ipynb - notebook with data cleaning and preprocessing steps and final visualizations and outputs.

## Summary of the Results
I was able to find the most expensive and cheapest neighborhoods to live in in Seattle. In addition, I found better reviews usually meant more bookings for the property than if a property ahd poor reviews. Lastly, having the "instant bookable" option led to slightly better number of bookings per year.
